Thanks for using my open source! I am NOT responsible for repercussions caused by using this code.
If you are here I expect you have a basic understanding of files and using bots so this won't go
too deep into the logistics of things. If you have trouble with setting up the requirements,
Google is always free.

You'll need to have Python installed on your computer with path before you can use this (obviously)

Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to the directory (cd filename) with the selfbot in it
and type:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Check out the config.json file to personalize your little nuke lol.

To change the server icon, you have to add the picture you want to these files and write the
pic name in config.json.

!IMPORTANT! in config.json you MUST put your bot token for it to work!

Run the main.py file.

Before you nuke the server, make sure your bot role is above all others for maximum destruction
(or else it won't delete some roles, ban some members etc even if it has Administrator)

Type ;fuck in any channel and watch the magic happen. All of the commands are going to run
asynchronously. (Except deleting channels and banning members because those are a priority.)

Love,
